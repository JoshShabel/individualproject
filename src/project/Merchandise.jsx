                <p>Over the last years multiple people asked for OpenWrt merchandise, be it shirts or stickers. Since
                    OpenWrt is a non-profit organization, we neither make nor sell anything ourselves. However there are
                    companies and groups that sell OpenWrt themed merchandise and may even donate a part of their
                    revenue to OpenWrt.</p>
                <p>This pages collects links to entities selling OpenWrt merch. If you sell OpenWrt themed merchandise
                    and want your information added here, please contact <code>contact at openwrt dot org</code>.</p>
